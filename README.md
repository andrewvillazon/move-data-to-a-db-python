# Move data to a Database with Python

Data and code examples to accompany tutorial series on moving data to a database with Python.

This repository contains 3 different ways to take data from an external source, a CSV file, and put its contents into a database using Python:

* [Move data to a Database with Python: Pure Python](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/move-data-to-db-with-pure-python/)
* [Move data to a Database with Python: SQLAlchemy](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/move-data-to-db-with-sqlalchemy/)
* [Move data to a Database with Python: Pandas](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/move-data-to-db-with-pandas/)

The data used in this repository comes from the [New York City Airbnb Open Data ](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) from Kaggle's [public dataset repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
